// Typescript is a "Type Saftey" version of javascript and is mainly used to idemtofy error before the runtime 
// JS does not provide static checking but TS does provide it 
// The only job of TS is to analyze the code as we type it .
// DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
// TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript Code 


// INTRO

const  user= {name:"shubham", age:19}
console.log("shubham bhatt", user.name);

// situations where TS is helpful

// ex- a function accepting 2 numbers :- don't need to explicity test

// ex- a function returning a string 

// declaring a variable
